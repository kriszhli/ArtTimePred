# Towards the Generation of Future Artwork: The Time Predictor
This paper examined the relationship between time and artwork, hypothesizing that famous art-works from a similar period should encode information about cultural environments and a general understanding of the arts. Therefore, predicting the date of artworks in a rough manner should be a valid task based on the hypothesis above. Specifically, this paper investigated 1) What is the best type of Task for Artworkâ€™s chronology? Classification, Regression, or Generation? and 2) Which representation of artworks contains richer chronological information? CLIPS embeddings or PCA embeddings?
